# This file is now deprecated and replaced by modular pipeline classes.
# Use ManualProcessingPipeline, AutomaticProcessingPipeline, or HybridProcessingPipeline from the pipeline folder.

# from .pipeline_manual import ManualProcessingPipeline
# from .pipeline_automatic import AutomaticProcessingPipeline
# from .pipeline_hybrid import HybridProcessingPipeline

# (Optionally, you can keep a factory or dispatcher here if you want to instantiate by mode.)
