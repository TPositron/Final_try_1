Hybrid Processing Pipeline - Combined Manual/Automatic Workflow

This module implements a hybrid processing pipeline that combines elements of both
manual and automatic processing modes. It allows users to have automated processing
with manual intervention points and parameter adjustment capabilities.

Main Class:
- HybridProcessingPipeline: Combined workflow with manual override capabilities

Key Features (To Be Implemented):
- Automatic processing with manual checkpoints
- User intervention at critical decision points
- Parameter adjustment during automated workflow
- Fallback to manual mode when automatic processing fails
- Preview and confirmation steps for automatic results

Dependencies:
- Inherits from: pipeline_base.ProcessingPipelineBase (shared functionality)
- Called by: ui/workflow_controller.py (hybrid mode selection)
- Called by: services/workflow_service.py (pipeline orchestration)

Planned Workflow:
1. Start with automatic parameter detection
2. Present preview and allow manual adjustment
3. Execute automatic processing with user checkpoints
4. Allow manual intervention at any stage
5. Combine automatic efficiency with manual precision

Note: This is a stub implementation for future development phases.
The hybrid mode will be implemented based on user feedback and requirements.
